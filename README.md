# Purpose

This is a repo of example Docker containers for deployment into Scaleway Serverless Environment. These are known working examples
which serve to inform and provide "jumping off" points for people
to build their own.

## Example containers
These containers represent the bare-minimum that I could create in
order to get a working endpoint deployed into Scaleway serverless.


### Python
This is a simple webserver which will echo back a successful response
from the built-in python HTTPServer module.

### Node
Todo - example expressjs sample with single endpoint


### Java
Todo - example api sample with single endpoint

## How to deploy

  1. clone this repo
  1. copy Makefile.sample to Makefile
  1. edit the `Makefile` and enter in your credentials
  1. ready to roll!
